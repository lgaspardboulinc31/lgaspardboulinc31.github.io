Maybe one of the only Team sport that was thriving at the time! I used to play twice a week, one session of practice and one session of free play. I have been part of the Volley Ball club for the four years I have spent at the ENS, even endorsing the role of manager of the club.</p> <p>The Volley Ball Club of the ENS is particularly involved in the <b>university tournaments</b>. We aligned multiple teams (2 men and 1 women) in the universities’ championships. We also participated in multiple events such as La Nuit du Volley and La Coupe de l’X at &lt;/Ecole Polytechnique, le TOSS at Ecole Centrale Supelec or the GOST (Girls Only Sup’optic Trophy). With more or less victories!</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="assets/img/project_preview/IMG_9602.jpeg" alt="Curie" style="height:100px;"> <img src="assets/img/logo/IMG_9602.jpeg" alt="CRCL" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> <img src="assets/img/logo/IMG_9604.jpeg" alt="IPNP" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> <img src="assets/img/logo/IMG_9605.jpeg" alt="IPNP" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> <img src="assets/img/logo/IMG_9603.jpeg" alt="IPNP" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"> </div> <h1 id="managing-the-volley-ball-club">Managing the Volley Ball Club</h1> <p>As the manager of the Volleyball Club at ENS, I took on a variety of responsibilities to ensure the smooth operation and growth of the club.
