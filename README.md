# Personal page
 My personal page has been forked from al-folio, **A simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.** that you can find here :
 [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/alshedivat/al-folio)](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/latest)

Thus, the repository is a bit messy while I personalized the template and put my info to date !
