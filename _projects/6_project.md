# The Volley-Ball club

The Volleyball Club of the ENS is open to all. Maybe one of the only Team sport that was thriving at the time! I used to play twice a week, one session of practice and one session of free play. I have been part of the Volley Ball club for the four years I have spent at the ENS, even endorsing the role of manager of the club.

The Volley Ball Club of the ENS is particularly involved in the <b>university tournaments</b>. We aligned multiple teams (2 men and 1 women) in the universities' championships. We also participated in multiple events such as La Nuit du Volley and La Coupe de l'X at </Ecole Polytechnique, le TOSS at Ecole Centrale Supelec or the GOST (Girls Only Sup'optic Trophy). With more or less victories!

# Managing the Volley Ball Club

As the manager of the Volleyball Club at ENS, I took on a variety of responsibilities to ensure the smooth operation and growth of the club. My duties included:

<ul>
    <li> Overseeing training sessions: Organizing regular practices and collaborating with the sports teacher to plan thematic sessions that enhanced both skill development and team cohesion.</li>
    <li> Managing logistics: Setting up and dismantling the volleyball court for each session or event.</li>
    <li> Recruitment and participation: Actively recruiting new members, coordinating tournaments, and leading the club’s participation in university championships.</li>
    <li> Fostering community: Organizing social events like the Galette du Volley or post-training snacks (goûters) to build camaraderie among members.</li>
    <li> Facilitating competition: Registering the club for major tournaments and ensuring the team had proper equipment, including ordering new uniforms.</li>
    <li> Expanding visibility: Establishing the club's Instagram account to showcase our activities.</li>

I am incredibly proud of the work I accomplished during my time as manager, but I am even more thrilled to see how my successors have taken the club to new heights. Their dedication and creativity have truly made the Volleyball Club one of the most vibrant and active student organizations at ENS.
