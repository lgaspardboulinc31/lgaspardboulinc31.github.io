Hi There ! Welcome to my personal page to get to know me !
My reserach focuses on understanding cancer mechanisms by harnessing innovative transcriptomics technologies and bio-informatics methods. My current PhD project focuses on brain tumors and how their spatial heterogeneities participate in tumor progression and relapse. I am carrying my research under the supervision of <a href="https://institut-curie.org/team/cavalli"> Florence Cavalli </a> and <a href="https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot"> Emmanuel Barillot </a> in the <a href="https://institut-curie.org/unit/u1331"> U1331-Computational Oncology Lab </a> at Institute Curie, Paris, France.

Beyond my research, I am particularly keen on raising awarness on mental health and dedicated to make the world a better place. It is mostly by taking part to multiple associations that I hope to have a small impact around me, from promoting health to organizing fun event. My missed career is event organizer, but who knows what the future holds.
