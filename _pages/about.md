Hi There ! Welcome to my personal page to get to know me ! 

I am currently personalizing the website so not everything is up to date. 

However, I can already tell you that I am a 25 years old PhD Student in Florence Cavalli's Team at Institute Curie. 
My work focuses on the deadly brain tumors and how their spatial heterogeneities participate in tumor progression and relapse. 
To answer these challenges, I am harnessing spatial transcriptomics technology and bio-informatics. 

Beyond my research, I am particularly keen on raising awarness on mental health and dedicated to make the world a better place. It is mostly by taking part to multiple associations that I hope to have a small impact around me, from promoting health to organizing fun event. My missed career is event organizer, but who knows what the future holds !
