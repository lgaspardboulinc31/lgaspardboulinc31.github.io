	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous malignancy, where the persistence of chemo-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs) contributes to disease relapse. We have previously demonstrated the clinical significance of WNT/β-catenin signaling in driving AML LSCs (Science, 327:1650-1653, 2010; Cancer Cell, 38:1-16, 2020). In this study, we uncover that GADD45a (growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible protein) is an essential regulator of β-catenin signaling pathway and its loss promotes LSC function and leukemia progression.Transgenic knockout of Gadd45a led to a progressive increase in aberrant self-renewal and leukemogenesis in vivo. Gadd45a-/- leukemic cells developed a more aggressive leukemia with a shorter latency than Gadd45a+/+ cells in mice, indicating the involvement of Gadd45a loss in AML initiation and progression. Subsequent serial transplantation experiments showed that Gadd45a deletion enhanced LSC self-renewal in vivo. In agreement with our findings in murine LSCs, deletion of GADD45a by CRISPR/Cas9 in AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells revealed increased engraftment and tumor burden in NSG mice. Consistent with our phenotypic observations, knockout of GADD45a increased βcatenin activity and key WNT/self-renewal target genes in human AML cells. In addition, our cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) data showed that GADD45a deletion in patient-derived LSCs was associated with cell metabolism, reactive oxygen species and tumor progression, as well as poor patient outcomes in AML. Further studies are being conducted to evaluate transcriptional mechanisms discovered by our single-cell sequencing.Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that GADD45a loss promotes LSC potential and consequently enhances tumor growth in murine and PDX models of AML, thus showcasing GADD45a as a promising therapeutic target in AML.References:Wang Y, Krivtsov AV, Sinha AU, et al.

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with limited therapeutic options against leukemic stem cells (LSCs), resulting in poor clinical outcomes for decades. We have demonstrated the clinical importance of aberrant activation of RSPO3/β-catenin pathway in a subset of poor prognosis AML (Cancer Cell, 38:263-278, 2020) and its ability to sustain low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a critical characteristic of human LSCs. This current study has extended our recent finding, and for the first time linked the pathway activation to ferroptosis resistance, a new drug resistance mechanism in cancer therapy. Our single-cell multiomics data in patient-derived xenograft mouse models of relapsed AML showed that the pathway activation in human LSCs led to upregulation of 43 differentially expressed genes associated with iron detoxification (e.g., FTH1) and ROS sensing/detoxification (e.g., PRDX1), two key features of ferroptosis resistance. Consistent with this observation, we found that AML patient specimens with favourable outcomes, which are independent of RSPO3 pathway, were sensitive to RSL3 treatment leading to increased cell death associated with elevated levels of intracellular ROS and iron. In contrast, AML patient specimens with poor clinical outcomes, which critically depend on RSPO3 pathway activation for survival and maintenance of myeloid undifferentiated state, revealed resistance to ferroptosis inducers (e.g., RSL3). Intriguingly, we found that anti-RSPO3 antibody, a clinical-grade drug that inhibits AML LSCs by blocking the interaction of RSPO3 with its receptor, sensitizes human LSCs to RSL3 treatment, leading to reduced cell viability. Overall, this study is the first to demonstrate the role of ferroptosis resistance in human LSCs and provides an opportunity to develop precision combination therapy by concurrently targeting self-renewal and ferroptosis resistance to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with poor-risk AML.Citation Format: Nunki Hassan, Hangyu Yi, Lucie Gaspard-Boulinc, Jenny Wang.
